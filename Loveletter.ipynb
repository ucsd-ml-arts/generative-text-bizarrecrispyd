Longer sequences of text can be generated by calling the model repeatedly to seuquentially add characters.\n",

These weights and biases are the trainable parameters of the network that can be \"learned\".\n",

For the image above, we have 9 neurons, with 32 connections (each with weight), 9 biases. This makes for 41 trainable parameters). This diagram is a fully connected network (each node connects to every node on the next layer).
