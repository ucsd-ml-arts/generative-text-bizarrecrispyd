# Project 1 Generative Text - Magic Spice for Love Letter

Yudi Wang, yuw043@ucsd.edu


## Abstract

Love letter is a traditional but still popular way to impress our lovers; yet write an successful one is hard. What's the key elements that makes the unique love letter in the world? In what way it impress people? In this project, RNN is adopted to generate brand new love letter according to the sample love letter collected via internet. In the first stage, I only adopt the short love letter graph dataset; but in later stage, I will try to mix some poetic sentences, famous love letter in the history and also short stories to make it seems more authentic. After doing all of that, I'll mix really love letters with those fake ones and invite several friends to make judgement and give comments. If the error rate is around or even lower than the mixture rate, which means they are just doing random guess, I think this project is quite successful.
