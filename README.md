## Abstract

Love letter is a traditional but still popular way to impress our lovers; yet write an successful one is hard. What's the key elements that makes the unique love letter in the world? In what way it impress people? In this project, RNN is adopted to generate brand new love letter according to the sample love letter collected via internet. In the dataset, there are also  some poetic sentences, famous love letter in the history and also short stories, which try to make the result more authentic. 


After tuning the model, several romantic pieces are generated. They are mixed with really love letters to consist a questionnaire. I invite several friends to make judgement and give comments. From the result we can conclude that people whose native language is not English cannot pick the right fake one.
